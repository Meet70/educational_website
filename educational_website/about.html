              <h2 class="text-center"> Mr Meet Chothani </h2>
               <p> Hey there, My name is Meet Chothani. I am 15 years old. I am from Gujrat state in India. I am in 9th standard. I am professional web developer and an online enterpreneur.I have created this website by my own using HTML & CSS. My hobby is to learn different types of programming languages. I am a youtuber. My goal is to give free education to the world whatever i gain knowledge from my mother, father, friends, relatives and teachers. I am from middle class family. I likes to use different social media platforms like twitter, instagram and facebook for educational purpose.</p>
               
               <p> I put topics in youtube which I think will be good for students. I also teach to students of standard 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>. I provides motivation which helps them to get success in their life.  I usually teach by using some what new style and technique like by the practicals and by showing different types of same real-life examples which makes their interest more. I gives them some tough and competitve questions and tasks. With studies I also give fun in between where they did not feel bore.  </p>
